# State-Of-The-Art-Text-Classification-with-RoBERTa-and-ULMFiT

State-Of-The-Art Natural Language processing in Text Classification using RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) 
which was released by Facebook AI in July 2019. Here in this research I have used RoBERTa method and my friend Monica (Haihong) Ma 
used ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for Text Classification) for predicting the percentage of review being positive and 
negative by using Amazon reviews data. After comparing the results of both models we can say, RoBERTa's performance is much better than 
ULMFiT for all classification models.
